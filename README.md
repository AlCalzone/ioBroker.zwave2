<h2 align="center">Z-Wave for ioBroker. But better.</h3>

Z-Wave 2 is a brand new Z-Wave implementation for ioBroker. It is based on [`zwave-js`](https://github.com/AlCalzone/node-zwave-js), which was written from the ground up for your benefit.

Unless [`ioBroker.zwave`](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.zwave/) it does not require `OpenZWave`. This means that the installation and updates are fast, and no compilation of static libraries and other complicated steps are necessary.

Furthermore, some devices just don't work in the original adapter, e.g. the Fibaro Roller Shutter 3.

Easy usage in ioBroker was kept in mind during the whole development. For example, some devices reuse configuration parameters to configure many different things. In this adapter, most of them are split into separate states and no complicated math is necessary:
| Config params in ioBroker.zwave2 | vs | Config params in ioBroker.zwave |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](docs/de/images/config-params.png) | vs | ![](docs/de/images/config-params-legacy.png) |

## Changelog
[Older changes](CHANGELOG_OLD.md)
<!--
	Placeholder for next versions:
	### __WORK IN PROGRESS__
-->

### 1.0.0 (2020-06-04)
* Changed the compatibility config queries for Danfoss thermostats, so queued setpoint changes are not overwritten

### 0.14.9 (2020-06-03)
* Placeholder object names (e.g. `Node 003`) for non-reachable nodes are now overwritten with the correct name when the nodes are interviewed.

### 0.14.8 (2020-06-03)
* Fixed an issue where secure sleeping nodes could block all communication with other nodes

### 0.14.7 (2020-06-03)
* Fixed an issue where interviews could get stuck for sleeping nodes
* Fixed a crash that happened when decoding a secure message with an unsupported payload

### 0.14.6 (2020-06-02)
* Added support for `Protection CC`
* Fixed several bugs in `Security CC`
* Updates from a node that span multiple messages are now correctly decoded
* During the startup, device objects are created for asleep and dead nodes. This allows removing failed devices from the network even after the cache was cleared.
