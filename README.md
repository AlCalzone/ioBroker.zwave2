<h2 align="center">Z-Wave for ioBroker. But better.</h3>

Z-Wave 2 is a brand new Z-Wave implementation for ioBroker. It is based on [`zwave-js`](https://github.com/AlCalzone/node-zwave-js), which was written from the ground up for your benefit.

Unless [`ioBroker.zwave`](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.zwave/) it does not require `OpenZWave`. This means that the installation and updates are fast, and no compilation of static libraries and other complicated steps are necessary.

Furthermore, some devices just don't work in the original adapter, e.g. the Fibaro Roller Shutter 3.

Easy usage in ioBroker was kept in mind during the whole development. For example, some devices reuse configuration parameters to configure many different things. In this adapter, most of them are split into separate states and no complicated math is necessary:

## Changelog
[Older changes](CHANGELOG_OLD.md)
<!--
	Placeholder for next versions:
	### __WORK IN PROGRESS__
-->

### 1.7.5 (2020-10-11)
* Fixed the creation of some missing states (`Alarm Sensor CC` in idle state, `Multilevel Switch CC` V1/V2)
* When a message should be sent to a node that is assumed to be dead, the node is now pinged first to check if it is really dead
* Improved compatibility with devices that support `Notification CC V2+` but send `V1` commands.

### 1.7.4 (2020-10-05)
* Added a configuration file for `Electronic Solutions DBMZ EU`
* Fixed a crash when receiving truncated messages
* Fixed a crash when trying to send secure commands with an expired nonce (`Security CC requires a nonce to be sent!`)
* Several fixes regarding battery-powered nodes (this should prevent the dreaded `E5` error on some thermostats, which was back since v1.7.0), including: 
  * Battery-powered nodes are actively sent to sleep again when they have no pending messages
  * Compatibility queries are now discarded when the node is asleep, avoiding duplicate queries on wakeup
  * Sending a node to sleep now continues to work even if it failed once

### 1.7.3 (2020-10-03)
* Fixed two crashes during the `Notification CC` interview

### 1.7.2 (2020-10-01)
* Added an option to improve the compatibility with legacy switches. If this option is enabled, `targetValue` (Binary and Multilevel Switch) will be overwritten with `currentValue` whenever `currentValue` is updated.
* When healing the network, the progress should now show up immediately
* Fixed two crash sources
* Several improvements to `Notification CC`
  * The interview now detects whether a node is push or pull
  * Push nodes now have their supporting values set to idle if no value is yet known
  * Pull nodes are now auto-refreshed every 6 hours and on wakeup
* Including secure devices now fails if the device takes too long to respond (as required by the specifications)

### 1.7.1 (2020-09-29)
* Added two options to increase the driver timeouts and/or send attempts. This should allow increasing the network stability at the cost of decreased responsiveness.
* Added support for `User Code CC V2`
* Fix: Nodes are no longer marked as dead or asleep if they acknowledge a message but don't respond to it
