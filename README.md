<h2 align="center">Z-Wave for ioBroker. But better.</h3>

Z-Wave 2 is a brand new Z-Wave implementation for ioBroker. It is based on [`zwave-js`](https://github.com/AlCalzone/node-zwave-js), which was written from the ground up for your benefit.

Unless [`ioBroker.zwave`](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.zwave/) it does not require `OpenZWave`. This means that the installation and updates are fast, and no compilation of static libraries and other complicated steps are necessary.

Furthermore, some devices just don't work in the original adapter, e.g. the Fibaro Roller Shutter 3.

Easy usage in ioBroker was kept in mind during the whole development. For example, some devices reuse configuration parameters to configure many different things. In this adapter, most of them are split into separate states and no complicated math is necessary:

## Changelog
[Older changes](CHANGELOG_OLD.md)
<!--
	Placeholder for next versions:
	### __WORK IN PROGRESS__
-->
### 2.5.0 (2022-04-03)
Updated `zwave-js` to `9.0.1`. This includes many changes, including the following:
* Worked around an issue where certain 500-series controllers take too long to respond when attempting communication with unreachable nodes
* Node queries now timeout faster if no response is received. This should avoid battery-powered nodes to go back to sleep mid-interview.
* Add support for `Irrigation CC`
* The legacy network cache file `<homeid>.json` was converted to an appendonly `.jsonl` file in order to prevent data loss
* Almost all CC API methods now validate their arguments, making it safer to execute custom commands from user code
* User codes and network keys are no longer included in logfiles
* Support for legacy devices which only support the obsolete `Multi Channel CC V1`
* New and updated configuration files, see [Z-Wave JS releases](https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js/releases) for details

### 2.4.5 (2022-02-20)
* Update `zwave-js` to `8.11.6`
* After healing, battery-powered nodes are sent back to sleep again
* Added a workaround for thermostats that don't advertise all their supported thermostat modes. When such a thermostat enters such an "unsupported" mode, the mode is now dynamically added to the list of supported modes.
* New and updated configuration files, see [Z-Wave JS releases](https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js/releases) for details

### 2.4.3 (2022-01-18)
* Updated translations
* Updated `zwave-js` from `8.9.1` to `8.11.2`. Check out the [releases](https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js/releases) for a detailed overview over the new and changed configuration files.
* Add support for `Humidity Control Mode CC`
* Add support for `Humidity Control Operating State CC`
* Add support for `Humidity Control Setpoint CC`
* Work around an issue where some devices could not be interviewed due to an incorrect `Version CC` response.
* Fixed an issue where `Supervision Get` requests were not answered for sleeping nodes
* Re-interviewing sleeping nodes now only resets the known information when the node wakes up
* The `colors` dependency was recently [corrupted on purpose](https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/9/22874949/developer-corrupts-open-source-libraries-projects-affected). This patch updates all dependencies that depended on an affected version, directly or indirectly.

### 2.4.2 (2021-12-23)
* Fix: Additional node-related commands now respect and update the node status
* Fixed an issue where the communication could get stuck after aborting a command
* New and updated configuration files, see [here](https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js/releases/tag/v8.9.0) and [here](https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js/releases/tag/v8.9.1)

### 2.4.2-beta.1 (2021-12-17)
* Fixed the check for incomplete or incorrect value IDs
