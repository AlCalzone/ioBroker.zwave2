<h2 align="center">Z-Wave for ioBroker. But better.</h3>

Z-Wave 2 is a brand new Z-Wave implementation for ioBroker. It is based on [`zwave-js`](https://github.com/AlCalzone/node-zwave-js), which was written from the ground up for your benefit.

Unless [`ioBroker.zwave`](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.zwave/) it does not require `OpenZWave`. This means that the installation and updates are fast, and no compilation of static libraries and other complicated steps are necessary.

Furthermore, some devices just don't work in the original adapter, e.g. the Fibaro Roller Shutter 3.

Easy usage in ioBroker was kept in mind during the whole development. For example, some devices reuse configuration parameters to configure many different things. In this adapter, most of them are split into separate states and no complicated math is necessary:
