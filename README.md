<h2 align="center">Z-Wave for ioBroker. But better.</h3>

Z-Wave 2 is a brand new Z-Wave implementation for ioBroker. It is based on [`zwave-js`](https://github.com/AlCalzone/node-zwave-js), which was written from the ground up for your benefit.

Unless [`ioBroker.zwave`](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.zwave/) it does not require `OpenZWave`. This means that the installation and updates are fast, and no compilation of static libraries and other complicated steps are necessary.

Furthermore, some devices just don't work in the original adapter, e.g. the Fibaro Roller Shutter 3.

Easy usage in ioBroker was kept in mind during the whole development. For example, some devices reuse configuration parameters to configure many different things. In this adapter, most of them are split into separate states and no complicated math is necessary:
| Config params in ioBroker.zwave2 | vs | Config params in ioBroker.zwave |

<!--
	Placeholder for next versions:
	### __WORK IN PROGRESS__
-->
### 1.9.0 (2021-03-16)
* Upgraded to `zwave-js` version 7
* Nodes with a completed interview are no longer queried for all their values when restarting. As a result the adapter is now ready much much faster after a restart, but you'll see many yellow values until the devices have sent updated data.
* The device list in the configuration dialog now displays a better type for the devices, for example `Wall Controller` instead of `Routing Slave`
* Network heal no longer times out early in large networks
* Fixed a crash: `supportedCCs is not iterable`. If this happens to you, re-interview affected devices.
* Relaxed the checks when a report gets mapped from the root endpoint to higher endpoints
* Some encrypted messages that were previously dropped are now accepted
* Prevent the interview of sleeping nodes to get stuck until a re-interview under certain circumstances
* After a restart, sleeping nodes have their status correctly determined even if they weren't interviewed completely before
* Notification variables are now auto-idled after 5 minutes as it was intended, not after 5 hours
* The `deltaTime` and `previousValue` values for the Meter CC are now hidden
* Fixed a crash that could happen after node inclusion
* Tons of new and improved device configuration files

### 1.8.12 (2021-02-23)
* Implemented `Scene Actuator Configuration CC` and `Scene Controller Configuration CC`
* Fixed an issue where sleeping nodes could block the send queue when it is not yet known whether they support `Wake Up CC`
* Fixed a crash that could happen while logging a message while the driver is not ready yet
* Fixed a crash that could happen while trying to bootstrap a device that does not respond after inclusion
* The state value in `Thermostat Fan Mode CC` is now readonly
* Configuration parameters may now have a unit
* Tons of new and improved device configuration files
* Unsolicited reports are no longer incorrectly mapped to all endpoints

### 1.8.11 (2021-02-14)
* Implemented `Thermostat Fan Mode CC` and `Thermostat Fan State CC`
* Fixed several sources of crashes
* Fixed incorrect detection of secure nodes
* Certain `.hex` firmware files are now parsed correctly
* Added support for `.bin` firmware files
* Avoid an infinite interview loop when devices don't advertise the end of the parameter list correctly
* Sleeping nodes are now immediately marked as ready when restarting from cache
* Unsolicited reports are no longer mapped from the root endpoint to endpoint 1 if that endpoint does not support the CC
* Tons of new and improved device configuration files

### 1.8.10 (2021-02-03)
* The startup should now be faster, especially if there are many sleeping devices
* Fixed an issue where devices were incorrectly displayed as secure
* Improved support for devices that use the legacy `Alarm CC`
* Several improvements for Zooz and GE devices

### 1.8.9 (2021-01-31)
* Labels for the Meter CC were improved to be unique
* Many config files were added and updated
* Improved compatibility with some devices, notably `ID Lock 150`, `Vision Security ZD2102-5`, `HomeSeer WD200+`
* `currentValue` and similar values are now updated immediately when a set-type command succeeds. Verification is done after a short delay.
