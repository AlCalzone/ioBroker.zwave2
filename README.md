<h2 align="center">Z-Wave for ioBroker. But better.</h3>

Z-Wave 2 is a brand new Z-Wave implementation for ioBroker. It is based on [`zwave-js`](https://github.com/AlCalzone/node-zwave-js), which was written from the ground up for your benefit.

Unless [`ioBroker.zwave`](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.zwave/) it does not require `OpenZWave`. This means that the installation and updates are fast, and no compilation of static libraries and other complicated steps are necessary.

Furthermore, some devices just don't work in the original adapter, e.g. the Fibaro Roller Shutter 3.

Easy usage in ioBroker was kept in mind during the whole development. For example, some devices reuse configuration parameters to configure many different things. In this adapter, most of them are split into separate states and no complicated math is necessary:

<!--
	Placeholder for next versions:
	### __WORK IN PROGRESS__
-->

### 1.7.4 (2020-10-05)
* Added a configuration file for `Electronic Solutions DBMZ EU`
* Fixed a crash when receiving truncated messages
* Fixed a crash when trying to send secure commands with an expired nonce (`Security CC requires a nonce to be sent!`)
* Several fixes regarding battery-powered nodes (this should prevent the dreaded `E5` error on some thermostats, which was back since v1.7.0), including: 
  * Battery-powered nodes are actively sent to sleep again when they have no pending messages
  * Compatibility queries are now discarded when the node is asleep, avoiding duplicate queries on wakeup
  * Sending a node to sleep now continues to work even if it failed once

### 1.7.3 (2020-10-03)
* Fixed two crashes during the `Notification CC` interview

### 1.7.2 (2020-10-01)
* Added an option to improve the compatibility with legacy switches. If this option is enabled, `targetValue` (Binary and Multilevel Switch) will be overwritten with `currentValue` whenever `currentValue` is updated.
* When healing the network, the progress should now show up immediately
* Fixed two crash sources
* Several improvements to `Notification CC`
  * The interview now detects whether a node is push or pull
  * Push nodes now have their supporting values set to idle if no value is yet known
  * Pull nodes are now auto-refreshed every 6 hours and on wakeup
* Including secure devices now fails if the device takes too long to respond (as required by the specifications)

### 1.7.1 (2020-09-29)
* Added two options to increase the driver timeouts and/or send attempts. This should allow increasing the network stability at the cost of decreased responsiveness.
* Added support for `User Code CC V2`
* Fix: Nodes are no longer marked as dead or asleep if they acknowledge a message but don't respond to it

### 1.7.0 (2020-09-25)
* The `quality` parameter is now set for state updates when reading (potentially stale) values from the cache
* Changed the serialport setting field to use autocomplete instead of a dropdown, added a tip how to use serial-over-tcp connections
* The adapter will now attempt to restart if starting the driver fails
* Upgraded `zwave-js` to version 5.0.0. This includes many changes including the following:
  * The driver has been completely rewritten with state machines for a well-defined program flow and better testability. This should solve issues where communication may get stuck for unknown reasons.
  * All interview messages now automatically have a lower priority than most other messages, e.g. the ones created by user interaction. This should make the network feel much more responsive while an interview process is active.
  * Improved performance of reading from the Value DB
  * A node is no longer marked as dead or asleep if it fails to respond to a `Configuration CC::Get` request. This can happen if the parameter is not supported.
  * The interview for sensor-type CCs is now skipped if a timeout occurs waiting for a response. Previously the whole interview was aborted.
  * If a node that is known to be included securely does not respond to the `Security CC` interview, it is no longer assumed to be non-secure
  * If a node that is assumed to be included non-securely sends secure commands, it is now marked as secure and the interview will be restarted
  * Added a configuration file for `ABUS CFA3010`.
  * Added a configuration file for `Everspring AC301`
  * Removed parameter #5 from `Aeon Labs ZW130` because it doesn't seem to be supported in any firmware version
  * In addition to real serial ports, serial-over-tcp connections (e.g. by using `ser2net`) are now supported. Use these `ser2net` settings to host a serial port: `<external-port>:raw:0:<path-to-serial>:115200 8DATABITS NONE 1STOPBIT`
  * Fixed a crash that could occur when assembling a partial message while the driver is not ready yet.
