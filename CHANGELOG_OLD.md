* After a complete interview, battery-powered nodes that are temporarily mains-powered (e.g. Multisensor 6 with USB power), are no longer sent into a "go to sleep" loop
* When a node requests multiple nonces in a short timespan, only respond to the most recent request

* Fix: Nodes are no longer marked as dead or asleep if they acknowledge a message but don't respond to it

## 1.7.0 (2020-09-25)

* Changed the serialport setting field to use autocomplete instead of a dropdown, added a tip how to use serial-over-tcp connections
* The adapter will now attempt to restart if starting the driver fails
* Upgraded `zwave-js` to version 5.0.0. This includes many changes including the following:
  * The driver has been completely rewritten with state machines for a well-defined program flow and better testability. This should solve issues where communication may get stuck for unknown reasons.
  * All interview messages now automatically have a lower priority than most other messages, e.g. the ones created by user interaction. This should make the network feel much more responsive while an interview process is active.
  * Improved performance of reading from the Value DB
  * A node is no longer marked as dead or asleep if it fails to respond to a `Configuration CC::Get` request. This can happen if the parameter is not supported.
  * The interview for sensor-type CCs is now skipped if a timeout occurs waiting for a response. Previously the whole interview was aborted.
  * If a node that is known to be included securely does not respond to the `Security CC` interview, it is no longer assumed to be non-secure
  * If a node that is assumed to be included non-securely sends secure commands, it is now marked as secure and the interview will be restarted
  * Added a configuration file for `ABUS CFA3010`.
  * Added a configuration file for `Everspring AC301`

  * Fixed a crash that could occur when assembling a partial message while the driver is not ready yet.
